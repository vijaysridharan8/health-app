Hereâ€™s a summary of the issues faced while pushing your code to GitHub, how each was resolved, and the git commands used:

1. Remote origin already exists
Issue: When trying to add the remote, git reported: remote origin already exists.
Resolution: Updated the remote URL to the correct GitHub repository.
Command used: git remote set-url origin https://github.com/vijaysridharan8/health-app.git
2. Push rejected (non-fast-forward)
Issue: Pushing to GitHub failed with: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind its remote counterpart.
Resolution: Pulled the latest changes from the remote to sync histories.
Command used: git pull origin main
3. Refusing to merge unrelated histories
Issue: Pull failed with: refusing to merge unrelated histories.
Resolution: Allowed unrelated histories to be merged.
Command used: git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
4. Merge conflicts
Issue: Merge resulted in conflicts that needed to be resolved manually.
Resolution: Conflicts were resolved in the files, then the changes were staged and committed.
Commands used:
git add <filename>   # For each conflicted file after resolving
git commit           # Or with a message: git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
5. Unfinished merge (MERGE_HEAD exists)
Issue: Git reported: You have not concluded your merge (MERGE_HEAD exists).
Resolution: Completed the merge by committing the resolved changes.
Command used: git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
6. Final push to remote
Issue: Needed to update the remote repository with the resolved changes.
Resolution: Pushed the local branch to GitHub.
Command used: git push -u origin main
